# SDI LAB — Scent Distance Index

*An index observing the perceivable distance of scent in social space.*

---

## Manifesto

SDI does not evaluate whether a scent is pleasant or unpleasant.  
It only records how far a scent travels before being perceived.

Distance defines proximity.  
Proximity defines social boundaries.

SDI LAB documents these boundaries.

SDI LAB does not produce fragrance; it records presence.
